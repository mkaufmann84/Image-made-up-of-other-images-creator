# Image-made-up-of-other-images-creator
Takes an Image and makes the image be created of other images. So you will have an Image made up of other images.
Image_from_image.py makes the main image made up of a single image, while Image_from_many_Images.py can use a dataset of images to make the photo.
Examples include a cat made up of an eye, and obama made up of a part of the MNIST Dataset.
