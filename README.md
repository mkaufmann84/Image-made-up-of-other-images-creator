# Image-made-up-of-other-images-creator
Takes an Image and makes the image be created of other images. So you will have an Image made up of another image. 
Can also make the image fractal once by making the Image be made up of the same image. 

og_img is the image that will be replaced by smaller versions of filler_img.
